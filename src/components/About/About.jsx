            Hi, my name is Fl√°vio and I'm currently Team Manager of Olymp Trade
            Forex company and a web developer. Currently, I'm pursuing my last
            year of my Bachelor's in Software Engineering at Siberian Federal
            University. Over the past 6 years, coding has developed a passion of
            mine, specifically, in the realm of web development and blockchain.
            I've dedicated my time to gaining proficiency in development to
            better myself as a developer and problem solver. I am able to create
            clean and functional websites and confidently deliver products to my
            clients knowing that they are of high quality.{" "}
